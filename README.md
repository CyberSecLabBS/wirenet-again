# wirenet-again
InfoSec University project.

The only purpose is to attack the prediction of malConv and ember on the malware named Dark Tequila.

**This project has NO relation with the malware wirenet. This is an old name that was not changed.**

# Usage
To use this, it is important to install all the dependencies in the requirements.txt file and clone [ember](https://github.com/elastic/ember) inside the repo.

Maybe, some files may be not present because they are too large and so they are in a google drive storage account.
Anyway, many of them can be generated with the scripts in this repo.
