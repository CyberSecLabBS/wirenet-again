# wirenet-again
InfoSec University project.

The only purpose is to attack the prediction of malConv and ember on the malware named Dark Tequila.

**This project has NO relation with the malware wirenet. This is an old name that was not changed.**

# Usage
To use this, it is important to install all the dependencies in the requirements.txt file and clone [ember](https://github.com/elastic/ember) inside the repo.

Maybe, some files may be not present because they are too large and so they are in a google drive storage account.
Anyway, many of them can be generated with the scripts in this repo.

# Additional notes
The repo is very messy. Many external links can break if some file will be moved. So the repo will remain messy. It is **NOT** an **enterprise** software or similar. The only purpose is to contain the files of the attacks and the more related files (as the malware used, or benign software used to offuscate the malware).
